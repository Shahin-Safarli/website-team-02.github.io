Instructions were explained about the activities (especially the Class Maze puzzle) for participants and they got help for completing the levels. </p>

They mentioned how much they liked this project and enjoyed completing levels of activities. They even requested for another meeting with us trying some other activities together as well. Last but not least, certificates were their award for spending their time with us during Hour of Code.</p>

We worked together and devided the whole project into individual assignments. The speech for presentation of ADA University was discussed and a tutor for explaining the main points of the activity to the students was chosen.</p>

We didn’t give up and decided to bring our personal laptops. As a result, we managed to complete the number of computers which were needed. The location of the school was quite confusing, that’s why we had a hard time until we arrived there.</p>
